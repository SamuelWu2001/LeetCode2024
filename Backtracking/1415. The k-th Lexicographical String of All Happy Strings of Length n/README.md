## 1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n
üîó Link: [The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-th-lexicographical-string-of-all-happy-strings-of-length-n/description/)  
üí° Difficulty: Medium  
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: String, Backtracking

A happy string is a string that:

consists only of letters of the set ['a', 'b', 'c'].  
s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).  
For example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.  

Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.

Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, k = 3  
Output: "c"  
Explanation: The list ["a", "b", "c"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is "c".

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 4  
Output: ""  
Explanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.  

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, k = 9  
Output: "cab"  
Explanation: There are 12 different happy string of length 3 ["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]. You will find the 9th string = "cab"
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10
1 <= k <= 100

## UMPIRE Method:

### Understand
> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. What is the maximum value of `n`?  
   10
3. Any requirement on time/space complexity?
### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.
1. Backtracking  
   In this case, since the value of n is small, I think using a backtracking method to find out every combination will be appropriate. 
### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram.

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)  

see solution.cpp
### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.
   - Time complexity: O(2^n)
   - Space complexity: O(n)
