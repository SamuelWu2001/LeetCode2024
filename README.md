# LeetCode2024
Hi, my name is Samuel. Inspired by [Nollie Chen](https://github.com/nolliechyTW), I will be using C++ to solve LeetCode problems from [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice). I'll attempt to use the UMPIRE method to tackle each problem, and I'd like to invite everyone to discuss and learn together.
