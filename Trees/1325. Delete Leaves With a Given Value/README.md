## 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
üîó Link: [Delete Leaves With a Given Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/description/)  
üí° Difficulty: Medium    
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000

## UMPIRE Method:

### Understand
> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Any requirement on time/space complexity?
2. Is the array sorted?
### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.
1. DFS
   
### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram.

General Idea: Create a Set to store numbers. If the number is already in the Set, return True. Otherwise we reach the end of the array and return False.  
1. Create the Set
2. Iterate through the array
   - check if the number is already in the Set
   - add the number into the Set
3. Return False if we reach the end of the array

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)  

see solution.cpp
### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.
1. Assume n represents the number of items in the array.
   - Time complexity: O(nlog(n))
   - Space complexity: O(n)
2. Using an unordered_set, we can optimize the time complexity to O(n).
