üí° Difficulty: Medium    
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: Hash Table, String, Bit Manipulation, Prefix Sum

Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must appear an even number of times.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"  
Output: 13  
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains two each of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"  
Output: 5  
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains two e's.  

Example 3:

Input: s = "bcbcbc"  
Output: 6  
Explanation: In this case, the given string "" is the longest because all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5
s contains only lowercase English letters.

## UMPIRE Method:

### Understand
> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Any requirement on time/space complexity?
### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.
1. Prefix Sum  
   We can use a integer to represents the status. And once we find out that there are two index wwith the same status, we can know that the subsequence between them is qualified.  
### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram.

General Idea: Create a integer to record the status and use an unordered_map to store the status and its corresponding first index. If we encounter the vowel character, update the status and the map. And update the length for every character. 

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)  

see solution.cpp
### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.
1. Assume n represents the number of items in the array.
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(1)
