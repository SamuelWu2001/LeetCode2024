## 1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings
üîó Link: [Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-two-valid-parentheses-strings/description/)  
üí° Difficulty: Medium  
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: String, Stack  

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

 

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).

Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.

Return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of A and B:  answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, else answer[i] = 1.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: seq = "(()())"
Output: [0,1,1,1,1,0]
Example 2:

Input: seq = "()(())()"
Output: [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= seq.size <= 10000


## UMPIRE Method:

### Understand
> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Is the the depth of seq = "()()()" still 1?  
   Yes
3. Any requirement on time/space complexity?  
### Match 
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.

### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram.

General Idea: When there exists two consecutive same char (including '(' and ')') we need to change the group
1. Iterate through the given string
   - if curr element is the same as previous one, change the group
   - add the group into the result
2. Return result  
### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)  

see solution.cpp
### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.
1. Assume n represents the number of items in the array.
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(1)
