💡 Difficulty: Easy
🛠️ Topics: Array, Sort, Hash

=======================================================================================
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
=======================================================================================

- **Understand**
    - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
    - Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
    - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
- **Match**
    - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.
- **Plan**
    - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
    - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram.
- **Implement**
    - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)
- **Review**
    - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
    - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.
- **Evaluate**
    - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
    - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.
