## 2310. Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K
üîó Link: [Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-numbers-with-units-digit-k/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=dynamic-programming&status=TO_DO&difficulty=MEDIUM)

Given two integers num and k, consider a set of positive integers with the following properties:

The units digit of each integer is k.
The sum of the integers is num.
Return the minimum possible size of such a set, or -1 if no such set exists.

Note:

The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and the sum of an empty set is considered 0.
The units digit of a number is the rightmost digit of the number.
 

Example 1:

Input: num = 58, k = 9
Output: 2
Explanation:
One valid set is [9,49], as the sum is 58 and each integer has a units digit of 9.
Another valid set is [19,39].
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum possible size of a valid set.
Example 2:

Input: num = 37, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: It is not possible to obtain a sum of 37 using only integers that have a units digit of 2.
Example 3:

Input: num = 0, k = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum of an empty set is considered 0.
 

Constraints:

0 <= num <= 3000
0 <= k <= 9

## UMPIRE Method:

### Understand
> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
1. Any requirement on time/space complexity?
### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category.
1. Hashmap  
   In this case, we can use a hash table to store every possible unit digit and it's corresponding times. Then we can use num%10 to see if the number can be composed by number ends by k.
### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode.
> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram.

General Idea: Same as above section

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)  

see solution.cpp
### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples.
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.
### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity.
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution.
1. Assume n represents the number of items in the array.
   - Time complexity: O(1)
   - Space complexity: O(1)
